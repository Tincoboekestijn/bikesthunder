An ugly 2 player game about a lighning cloud and a cyclist.

Originally intended for the Global Game Jam last minute diversifier (to make and submit a game in the last hour of the jam), but we were too busy the rest of that hour.

Finished later in less than 2 hours.

## Gameplay

The cloud can move using the WASD keys.
The cloud can shoot lightning with the spacebar (with a 2 second cooldown).

The cyclist moves with the left and right arrow keys.

The cyclist dies when it hist the lightning or the edges of the room.

The cloud wins when the cyclist dies.
The cyclist wins when it can stay alive for one minute.
